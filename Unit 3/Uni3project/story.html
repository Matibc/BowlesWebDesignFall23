        Plastic Waste in Our Oceans

    <h2>Polution In The World</h2>
    <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater with harmful substances. It is a major environmental issue that has serious implications for human health, marine life, and ecosystems. The sources of water pollution are diverse and can include industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.

        It is the contamination of water sources making that water un usable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and more. some of these pollutants include: chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites.
        <br>
        <br>
          5.25 trillion pieces of waste are in our oceans. In terms of plastics 8.3 million tons of plastic are discarded in the sea yearly. 80% of this waste comes from the surface, from us humans.

    <h2>Causes of Pollution</h2>
    <p>
        One of the most common causes of water pollution is industrial discharge. Many industries release toxic chemicals and heavy metals into water bodies, which can have detrimental effects on aquatic life and pose serious health risks to humans who consume contaminated water. For example, chemicals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium can accumulate in fish and other seafood, leading to health problems in people who consume them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Agricultural runoff is another significant source of water pollution. Pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste from farms can wash into water bodies, leading to the proliferation of harmful algal blooms and the contamination of drinking water supplies. These pollutants can have far-reaching impacts on both human and ecological health, as they can cause respiratory issues, skin irritation, and even neurological disorders in humans, and can lead to the death of aquatic life due to oxygen depletion and the release of toxins.

        <br>
        One of the primary sources of water pollution is industrial waste. Chemicals and toxins from factories and manufacturing plants can be released into rivers, lakes, and oceans, contaminating the water and harming aquatic life. In addition, agricultural runoff, which includes pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste, can also contribute to water pollution.</p>
